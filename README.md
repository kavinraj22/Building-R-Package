# Building-R-Package
I have build an R package and saving it here in GitHub

To build a new R package, we will have install some packages 

Installation

``` r
>install.packages("devtools")
>install.packages("roxygen2")
>library(roxygen2)
>library(devtools)
>install_github("devtools", "hadley")

```
